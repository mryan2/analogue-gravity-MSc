# MSc Project: Gravitational Wave Simulation

Implementation, using the Python programming language, of a simple numerical, 
computer-based visualisation of gravitational waves emitted by two orbiting bodies.

## Features
- 3D visualization of gravitational waves.
- User-controlled camera rotation and zoom for interactive exploration.
- A GUI for parameter customization.
