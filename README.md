# MSc Project: Visualization of Gravitational Waves Using a Computational Analogue Model
Implementation, using the Python programming language, of a simple numerical, 
computer-based visualisation of gravitational waves emitted by two orbiting bodies. 

## Features
- 3D visualization of gravitational waves.
- User-controlled camera rotation and zoom for interactive exploration.
- A GUI for parameter customization.

## Thesis Text
This is provided in both the original editable format (MS Word for Windows) and as a PDF.
